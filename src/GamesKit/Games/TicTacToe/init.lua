Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple two-player game. The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Rules:

1. Player 1 is X, and Player 2 is O.
2. Players take turns to place their symbol on an empty cell on the grid.
3. The game continues until one player gets three of their symbols in a row or the grid is full, resulting in a draw.

## Winning:

To win, you must create a row, column, or diagonal of three of your marks before your opponent does. The first player to do so is the winner.]=];
